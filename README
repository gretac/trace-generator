SUPER TRACE GENERATOR 3000 XTREME+ TURBO

Too lazy to collect traces? Generate your own!

Specify the desired trace behaviour in the included config file. The config
file is fairly straight forward, each line maps to an individual process. So
if you're specifying multiple attributes for the same process, they should
all be on the same line. The script will look for the config file in 
~/code/trace_generator/ by default, but if you don't like that, then you 
can edit the source >:[. Careful not to insert any extra lines in the 
config file as the script is reading from specific line numbers. The trace 
will be generated in the same directory that the script is run. Please note
that it is possible to configure the trace generator in such a way that you
have several events occurring with the same timestamp..
