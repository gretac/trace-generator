SUPER TRACE GENERATOR 3000 XTREME+ TURBO

Too lazy to collect traces? Generate your own!

Specify the desired trace behaviour in the included config file. The script 
will look for the config file in ~/code/ by default, but if you don't like 
that, then you can edit the source >:[. Careful not to insert any extra lines 
in the config file as the script is reading from specific line numbers. The 
trace will be generated in the same directory that the script is run.
