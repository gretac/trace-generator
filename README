SUPER TRACE GENERATOR 3000 XTREME+ TURBO

Too lazy to collect traces? Generate your own!

Specify the desired trace behaviour in the included config file. The script will look for the config file in
~/code/ by default, but it you don't like that, then you can edit the source >:[. Careful not to insert any extra
lines in the config file as the script is reading from specific line numbers. The trace will be generated in
the same directory that the script is run.
